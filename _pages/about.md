I am currently a second-year PhD student in Machine Learning and Operations Research at Polytechnique Montreal. I work within the Department of Computer Science (GIGL) under the supervision of [Quentin Cappart](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/cappart-quentin-0) (Polytechnique Montréal, UCLouvain, CIRRELT, MILA), and [Antoine Legrain](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/legrain-antoine-0) (Polytechnique Montréal, CIRRELT, GERAD). My research focuses on applying Robust and Constrained Reinforcement Learning with World Models to solve Multi-Agents Combinatorial Optimization Problems. Additionally, I am particularly interested in applying Reinforcement Learning (RLVR) to post-train LLM to solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems and I am also interested in applying Diffusion Models/Flow Matching to graphs and times series.
